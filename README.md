# PasswordGenerator

# Introduction
I understand companies deal with sensitive data day in and day out. I wanted create a randomly generated a password that can meet the specific criteria so that you can create a strong password that provides greater security for your company.

# Code Samples
When you click the button to generate a password

You will be presented with a series of prompts for password criteria

Which at that point you can select which criteria to include in the password

When you are prompted for the length of the password I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters

When prompted for character types to include in the password it will ask you to choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters

When you answer each prompt the password will generate the matches from the selected criteria

Then password will be displayed in the page so you can copy it.
